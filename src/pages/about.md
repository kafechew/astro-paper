# kheAI: Body, Mind & ₿itcoin  

> “Today, as always, men fall into two categories: slaves and free men.  
> He who does not own two-thirds of his day is a slave — no matter what he calls himself: a politician, a businessman, a scholar, or a civil servant.”  
> — *Friedrich Nietzsche*  

> “I’m not rejecting the world — I just refuse to let it decide how I live.”

## 🧩 The Problem  
Modern slavery doesn’t wear chains.  
It hides behind **debt, distraction,** and **dependence.**  

We trade our time for comfort, our attention for noise, and our freedom for convenience — all while believing we’re in control.  

---

## 🎯 The Goal  
**True Freedom** — to live well without selling your time.  
To create, move, and think freely — on your own terms.  

---

## 🛤️ The Path
