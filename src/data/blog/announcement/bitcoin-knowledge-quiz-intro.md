It started with a simple question:  
**How do we make learning about Bitcoin less overwhelming — and more fun?**

If you’ve ever tried to explain Bitcoin to a friend or dive deeper into its inner workings, you probably know the feeling. One minute you're talking about digital money, the next you're deep in cryptographic signatures, supply caps, halving events, and the Lightning Network.

I’ve been there myself — confused, curious, and occasionally lost in a sea of blog posts, whitepapers, and Twitter threads. But what I learned over time is that **repetition and feedback** are the secret sauce to making all this complexity stick.

So we built something small but powerful:  
🎯 **[The Bitcoin Knowledge Quiz](https://www.kheai.com/quiz)** — a bite-sized, interactive way to test what you know, learn what you don’t, and have a little fun along the way.

## Why a Quiz?

Because Bitcoin education shouldn’t feel like homework.  
We wanted something more **dynamic than a textbook**, but more **focused than a YouTube rabbit hole**.

Quizzes are:
- Low-commitment (5–10 minutes)
- Repeatable and random
- Surprisingly good at revealing what you *think* you know but actually don’t

They also reward curiosity. You learn something new every time — even when you get it wrong.

## What’s Inside?

There are currently two quiz sets:

### 1. Bitcoin Basics  
Perfect if you’re just getting started. Questions like:
- Who created Bitcoin?
- Why only 21 million BTC?
- What *is* a blockchain, really?
- What’s the deal with mining?

### 2. Bitcoin Advanced  
Great if you're ready to flex deeper knowledge:
- How does difficulty adjustment work?
- What’s the impact of halving cycles?
- What’s the Lightning Network and why does it matter?
- Have you mastered Bitcoin slang like HODL, NGU, and UTXO?

Each time you visit, you'll get a different set of questions.  
And every answer comes with **instant explanations**, so you’re learning even as you go.

## Designed for Humans

We kept things simple on purpose:

- **Mobile-friendly** — Works beautifully on your phone
- **No login required** — Just jump in
- **Visual progress tracking** — Know where you stand
- **Instant scoring** — Get feedback and try again

It's a fast way to challenge yourself, refresh your knowledge, or just kill time in a way that actually makes you smarter.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. We’re already working on more:

- Bitcoin Economics (monetary policy, inflation, markets)
- Bitcoin History (early adopters, Mt. Gox, the block wars)
- Bitcoin Tech Deep Dives (nodes, mempools, SegWit, Taproot)
- User accounts and progress tracking
- Leaderboards for some friendly competition
- Daily quiz challenges

If it helps people learn Bitcoin better — we’ll probably build it.
