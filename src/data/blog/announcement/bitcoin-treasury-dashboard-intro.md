# Introducing the Bitcoin Treasury & Lightning Dashboard  
## A Sovereign’s Command Center for Managing Bitcoin and Lightning

---

There was a moment — not too long ago — when I opened three different apps, four browser tabs, and still didn’t know what I wanted to know:

> *How am I really doing, financially — in Bitcoin terms?*

I could see my sats balance.  
I could see the BTC price.  
I could even SSH into my Lightning node and run some commands.

But it still felt... fragmented. Too many silos. Too much friction.  
Not enough *clarity*.

And I realized: Bitcoin has evolved. My setup had evolved. But my **visibility hadn’t**.

So I did what any stubborn Bitcoiner might do.

I built something for myself — and now I’m sharing it with you.

## 🛠 Why I Built It

I’ve always believed that **Bitcoin isn’t just money — it’s infrastructure**.  
It deserves tools that treat it with that same gravity.

But most dashboards out there are:
- Built for *traders*, not long-term thinkers.
- Centralized, ad-driven, or KYC-heavy.
- Focused on price, but not *strategy*.

So I asked:

> *What if a sovereign individual — or a small, Bitcoin-native business — had a clean, personal command center for managing their treasury and Lightning node?*

No fluff.  
No financial surveillance.  
Just the right data, at the right time, in one place.

## 🧭 What You’ll See

The first version is now live, and it already feels like something I wish I had years ago.

### 🏦 **Treasury Overview**  
Your Bitcoin net worth, clearly displayed:
- Total sats held and USD value  
- Cost basis and P&L  
- Allocation chart (cold vs hot, on-chain vs off-chain)

### ⚡ **Lightning Node Stats** *(mocked for now)*  
Whether you're routing payments or just exploring:
- Channel count and total capacity  
- Local vs remote balance  
- Soon: uptime, peer stats, fee earnings

### 📈 **Market Context**
- Live BTC price and 24h performance  
- Countdown to next halving  
- Future: Bitcoin dominance, inflation, macro risk signals

### 🧾 **Recent Activity**
- Transaction log (on-chain)  
- Channel opens/closes (Lightning)  
- Placeholder for mempool monitoring and unconfirmed tx alerts

### 📊 **Performance Charts** *(coming soon)*
I’m working on visualizing:
- DCA performance  
- Sats over time  
- Routing revenue trends  
- Custom allocation drift

Even in this early version, it gives me peace of mind.

I can wake up, open one tab, and instantly see:
> *I’ve got X sats, Y channels open, BTC’s down 2%, I’m still 100% sovereign.*

## 🔮 Where It’s Headed

The dashboard is designed to grow with you — from curious beginner to Lightning operator to sovereign treasury strategist.

Coming soon:
- Real-time price + fee API integration
- 🔁 WebSocket data for node + wallet updates
- ⚠️ Alerts: channel drain warnings, missed yield, fee spikes
- 📡 Full LND or Core Lightning data feeds
- 🧠 kheAI Agent integrations for rebalancing suggestions & automation
- 🧾 Multi-wallet & xpub tracking
- 📉 Treasury simulation: future scenarios, drawdown stress tests

I’m not building a trading platform.  
I’m building a **mission control** for long-term Bitcoin thinkers.

## 🧘 Who This Is For

If you resonate with any of these, it’s built for you:

- You **run a Lightning node**, or want to start one
- You treat Bitcoin as your **long-term treasury**
- You want visibility without surveillance
- You value **ownership over convenience**
- You’re building something small, sovereign, and resilient

It’s also great for:
- Study groups 🧠  
- Family funds 🏠  
- Solopreneurs and microbusinesses accepting BTC 🧾  
- Quiet builders, hermits in the city, and the *“don’t trust, verify”* crowd 🕵️

## 🧡 Try the Alpha

It’s live, it’s free, and it’s still evolving:  
👉 [Explore the Bitcoin Dashboard](https://www.kheai.com/dashboard)

No login. No API key needed (yet). Just explore.

You’ll see mock data for Lightning stats (for now), but the foundation is solid and will support full integration soon.

## 🗣 What I Need From You

This is very much a builder-to-builder, sovereign-to-sovereign invite.

If you try it, I’d love your thoughts:
- What would make it indispensable?
- What’s *missing* from your current Bitcoin setup?
- What are you constantly tracking in spreadsheets or terminal windows?

You can reply, comment, DM, Nostr me, or just send a smoke signal.

Your feedback will shape how this dashboard grows — and whether it becomes something truly useful to more of us.

## Final Thoughts

We spend years stacking sats, reading whitepapers, optimizing security...

But most of us still don’t have a single clear view of our Bitcoin reality.

This dashboard won’t solve Bitcoin.  
But it just might give you the clarity and confidence to navigate it better.

Because at the end of the day, Bitcoin isn’t about charts.  
It’s about **freedom, time, and sovereignty**.

Let’s manage it like it matters.
