## 🔍 Step 1: Income Sources

For YA 2024, I had:

1. ✅ **Sole Proprietorship**: *Optimiser Commercial Solutions*  
   - No business income  
   - Bank balance kept at RM 1,000 by topping up every expense via owner deposit

2. ✅ **Residential Rental Income**  
   - RM 970/month × 12 months = **RM 11,640 total**

---

## 📒 Step 2: General Ledger – Optimiser Commercial Solutions

All expenses were funded by *Owner Deposits*. I ensured the business bank balance remained **RM 1,000** at all times.

## ✅ Summary

| Item                        | Amount (RM) |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Rental Income               | 11,640.00   |
| Sole Prop Net Loss          | (1,492.47)  |
| Total Reliefs               | 11,586.64   |
| Chargeable Income           | **0.00**    |
| Tax Payable                 | **RM 0.00** |

Even with RM 11,640 in rental income, my total chargeable income dropped to zero after reliefs and loss offset. Filing was simple because I documented every expense and submitted Form B properly.
