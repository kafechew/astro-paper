## ✨ Motivation

As part of my CoastFIRE journey, I decided to consolidate my PRS (Private Retirement Scheme) investments, which were scattered across multiple PRS Providers. This made it difficult to track performance and plan my long-term retirement strategy.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To consolidate everything into one fund:
**Principal PRS Plus Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Equity – Class C**, accessible via FSMOne.

---

## 📦 Original Holdings

| Fund Name | PRS Provider | Platform |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| AmPRS-Tactical Bond (Class D) | AmFunds Management Bhd | AmBank |
| Manulife Shariah PRS - Global REIT Fund | Manulife Investment Mgmt Bhd | FSMOne |
| Principal PRS Plus Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Equity – Class C | Principal Asset Management Bhd | FSMOne |

---

## 🔄 Switching vs Transferring

> Even though all funds were visible in FSMOne, **Manulife and AmFunds** are different PRS Providers from Principal.

So this required:
- ✅ **Transfer**, not switch
- ✅ **Two separate PPA Transfer Forms**

---

## 📋 Documents Required

For each provider, I prepared:

- ✅ PPA Transfer Form (CAPITAL LETTERS, black ink, hand-signed)
- ✅ FSMOne Transfer Instruction Form
- ✅ FSMOne Consent Letter
- ✅ NRIC front & back (printed vertically on A4)
- ✅ Latest PRS account statement

---

## 📬 Delivery Decision

FSMOne allows walk-in submission to:

```
FSMOne
Level 29, Menara AIA Sentral
No. 30, Jalan Sultan Ismail
50250 Kuala Lumpur
```

However, I opted for **Pos Malaysia Registered Mail (Pos Daftar)** from Lotus's Pusat Bandar Puchong Post Office.

- 📦 **Tracking Code**: RYXXXXXXXXXMY
- 📅 **Sent**: 18 January 2025

You can track Pos Daftar online.

---

## 📧 Email Communication

I emailed **Jecci** from FSMOne's PRS support team to confirm:

- ✅ All documents were in order (before mailing)
- ✅ Documents were sent via registered mail
- ✅ Awaiting internal processing and confirmation

---

## 🕒 What Happens Next?

The transfer process takes **1–2 months**:

1. FSMOne verifies and forwards documents
2. Manulife & AmFunds redeem units
3. Principal allocates new units
4. All tracked via [https://www.ppa.my](https://www.ppa.my)

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- 📝 Only **1 transfer per PRS provider per year**
- 🖋️ Fill forms carefully — **no correction tape**, no errors
- 🧾 Registered mail is safe, affordable, and trackable
- 📂 Pre-check your documents with FSMOne before sending

---

## ✅ Result

Soon, all my PRS investments will be in one fund I trust — with better performance tracking, portfolio focus, and peace of mind.
