description: Not your keys, not your money. Financial freedom isn’t about how much you have. It’s about how much control you have.

It was just another ordinary week. I had cash coming in from rent and some investments. Like most Malaysians trying to beat inflation, I transferred almost everything into **Touch ‘n Go (TnG) eWallet** to enjoy their GO+ interest savings.

I even felt proud. "I'm optimizing my idle cash," I told myself.

A few days earlier, I successfully registered for a **Business Wallet**, transferred funds in and out, no issues. Life was good.

But on **June 24, 2025**, that illusion cracked.

## ❌ Everything Failed On My Credit Card Due Date

It was the day I was supposed to pay my **UOB credit card bill**.

I launched the TnG app to make a transfer. I’d done it dozens of times before. But this time, it **failed**.

Tried again.
Failed.

I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I tried transferring to my **Maybank account** instead.

**Also failed.**

Every attempt hit a wall. No detailed error message. Just quiet rejection.

That’s when it hit me:

> **Every sen I owned was locked.**

No access. No backup. No safety net.

---

## 🥵 Desperate for Help

I scrambled to contact support. First the chatbot, then a live agent named Dannis. I explained the situation:

> I cannot transfer money with my TnG eWallet. I need to pay my credit card bills today. ALL my cash is in the eWallet!

Dannis asked if I had changed devices or received a fraud alert.

No. I was using the same phone. No suspicious emails.

He then asked for my IC and confirmed my email. He said I would receive an email soon that asked for many required verification documents.

I sent the documents **immediately.**

## ⌛ Then Came the Waiting Game

Nothing happened.

**For two full days**, I sat in anxious silence.

I followed up multiple times. This time I got another agent, Aiman. He told me:

> We have escalated your case to our higher department. Please wait 7 working days.

**7 working days.**

Meanwhile, my **credit card was overdue**. Penalties were adding up. I had no cash elsewhere because I moved it all to TnG to earn extra interest.

I even asked:

> Can TnG at least write a letter to UOB and Maybank to explain the delay?

No reply. No assistance. Just "please wait."

I was **locked out of my money**, and I had no idea why.

## 🔍 I Realized I'm Not Alone

While I waited, I began researching.

### National News:

It wasn’t just me. Many Malaysians had their eWallet accounts frozen, often with **no notice, no cause, no explanation.**

---

## 🚫 Resolution Without Explanation

Next Monday, I finally received an email from TnG's **Fraud Operations Team**:

> We have rectified the issue. You should be able to login.

That’s it.

No reason.
No apology.
No warning about what went wrong.

I tested by transferring **RM1,000 to Maybank**. It worked.

But the trust was broken. I immediately withdrew most of my balance, keeping under RM500 in the wallet.

## 🏦 Maybank vs TnG Support

During this crisis, I kept thinking:

> If this was Maybank, I could walk into a branch and get help on the spot.

With TnG, I had:

* No office
* No hotline
* No manager to speak to
* Just scripts from chat agents

**I felt completely powerless.**

---

## ⚡ It’s Not Just TnG — Look At BigPay

Right around the same time:

* BigPay's **CEO, COO, and top executives resigned**
* They were reportedly **being acquired by a regional bank**
* Users were **locked out for hours** during outages

These fintech apps look sleek, but they’re not banks.
And you have **zero control** when something goes wrong.

## 🤔 Lessons I Learned the Hard Way

1. **Never put all your cash in one platform**
2. **Digital wallets are not banks**
3. **Emergency funds should stay in a bank**
4. **Interest is meaningless if you lose access**
5. **Fintech apps have no urgency when you're in crisis**

## 🔐 Why Bitcoin Makes Sense Now

This experience forced me to ask:

> If I need permission to use my own money... do I really own it?

That’s when I turned to **Bitcoin**.

### With Bitcoin:

* You hold your own keys
* No one can freeze your funds
* No 7-day investigations
* No support tickets to access your savings
* No CEO resignation will affect your wallet

Bitcoin is **money without middlemen**.
It’s not in a company’s database. It’s on a **global ledger** that **you** control.

Yes, it requires self-responsibility. You need to learn self-custody, backup seed phrases, and secure your wallet.

But you’ll never have to beg anyone for access to your wealth again.

---

## 📊 What I’m Doing Now

* Keep < RM500 in eWallets
* Rebuild buffer in traditional bank accounts
* Learn hardware wallets for Bitcoin
* Teach others how to avoid what happened to me

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This blog isn’t to shame TnG. Outages happen. Mistakes happen.

But when **all your cash is locked**, and the only thing you hear is *"please wait 7 working days"*, it breaks you.

> I learned the hard way that **financial freedom isn’t about how much you have. It’s about how much control you have.**

If you’ve ever experienced something like this, or want to explore [Bitcoin](/tags/bitcoin) as a backup plan for financial sovereignty in Malaysia — **reach out**.

I never want anyone else to feel what I felt that week.
