*The Tradecraft Blueprint from DCA to Structured Equity and Preferred Instruments*

## 🛤️ Introduction: From Skeptic to Maximalist

Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, once dismissed Bitcoin. In 2013, he tweeted that Bitcoin’s days were numbered. But by 2020, with COVID-19 triggering economic chaos and global central banks printing trillions, he realized that fiat reserves were melting.

That realization sent him on a deep intellectual journey. With MicroStrategy’s cash reserves slowly losing value, Saylor began studying monetary history, inflation cycles, gold, and finally—Bitcoin. He and CFO Phong Le spent over **1,000 hours** researching BTC and brought in legal, accounting, and tax experts. At one point, Saylor reportedly read *The Bitcoin Standard* twice and rewatched hours of content from Bitcoin educators like Robert Breedlove and Andreas Antonopoulos.

To win over the board, Saylor proposed a **dual-track treasury strategy**:

* 50% in short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds (a conservative hedge)
* 50% in Bitcoin (a high-conviction, asymmetric bet on digital scarcity)

By framing Bitcoin not as speculation, but as a superior form of treasury reserve asset, Saylor won board approval. Thus began MicroStrategy’s transformation into **Strategy**, the world’s first Bitcoin-native public company.

## 📍 Phase 1: Foundation – Conviction and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

> The play is long Bitcoin, short the dollar. 

In August 2020, amid global money printing and 0% interest rates, Saylor directed MicroStrategy to invest **$250M** into Bitcoin. It wasn’t an impulsive buy—it came after weeks of discussions with board members, weighing the risks of holding dollars versus owning a deflationary digital asset.

The first purchase: **21,454 BTC** at $11,653 each. Over the next few months, MicroStrategy continued adding to its position through small and large BTC buys. This strategy mirrored the behavior of a retail investor using dollar-cost averaging (DCA).

### Why DCA?

* Minimizes timing risk
* Builds psychological and financial resilience
* Demonstrates long-term commitment

### Blueprint:

* Start with 5–10% of fiat reserves
* Execute weekly/monthly BTC purchases
* Custody BTC securely using multisig cold wallets

### Outcome:

* Built a reliable BTC foundation
* Sent a bold signal to Wall Street and crypto markets



## 📍 Phase 2: Expansion – Strategic Borrowing + Structured Debt

> Borrow against melting ice to buy an indestructible asset. 

After the success of the initial BTC investment and rising price appreciation, Saylor realized that Bitcoin offered the rare ability to *absorb capital efficiently*. He began raising funds through structured corporate debt.

In December 2020, MicroStrategy issued **$650M in convertible senior notes at 0% interest**, due 2025, with a **37.5% premium** to MSTR’s share price. Wall Street institutions bought in heavily, attracted by the structure and Bitcoin narrative. Over the next 18 months, Saylor issued **over $2 billion** in convertible notes.

### Why It Worked:

* Convertible bonds had long maturity dates
* No immediate dilution or repayment pressure
* All proceeds converted into BTC

### Blueprint:

* Issue unsecured, low-interest convertible notes
* Target institutional capital during bull cycles
* Deploy proceeds entirely into Bitcoin

### Outcome:

* Amplified BTC holdings
* Enhanced shareholder value with minimal dilution



## 📍 Phase 3: Acceleration – Flywheel: DCA + Leverage + Transparency

> You don’t sell your BTC. You borrow fiat against it, then buy more BTC. 

As MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stack grew, so did investor trust. Saylor capitalized on this momentum by scaling the BTC strategy through a flywheel:

1. **Buy BTC** →
2. **BTC appreciates** →
3. **Market rewards MSTR with higher stock price** →
4. **Raise more debt or equity** →
5. **Buy more BTC**

Saylor also instituted full BTC transparency. Each BTC acquisition was announced publicly, including cost basis, price per coin, and total holdings. This level of transparency became a brand asset.

### Blueprint:

* Use BTC as balance sheet signal to attract capital
* Maintain strict HODL policy (never sell BTC)
* Reinforce investor confidence with transparency

### Outcome:

* Over **33 BTC purchases** by early 2024
* **500,000+ BTC** held by Strategy and its affiliates



## 📍 Phase 4: Institutionalization – Equity Issuance, Brand Shift, and Thought Leadership

> MicroStrategy is now a dual engine: enterprise software + Bitcoin acquisition. 

In 2021, Saylor began hosting the **Bitcoin for Corporations** conference, educating CFOs, CEOs, and treasurers on Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Simultaneously, MicroStrategy rebranded itself to **Strategy** to signal its identity as a dual-mission company: software and Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, the company started using **At-The-Market (ATM) equity sales**—selling small amounts of stock at favorable prices when MSTR traded above its Bitcoin NAV. This strategy raised over **$3 billion**, with zero traditional investor roadshows or underwriters.

### Blueprint:

* Use brand to become a Bitcoin thought leader
* Educate the market while raising equity capital
* Only raise equity during high-price cycles

### Outcome:

* MSTR stock became a Bitcoin proxy
* Institutional investors saw BTC exposure without custody risk



## 📍 Phase 5: Capital Engineering – Preferred Instruments (STRK, STRF, STRD)

> To monetize conviction, you engineer yield without compromise. 



In 2024–2025, Saylor expanded Strategy’s capital stack by issuing **preferred stock instruments** to target income-seeking investors:

#### ✅ STRK ("Strike") – Convertible Preferred:

* 8% dividend
* Convertible into MSTR at a premium ($1,000/share)

#### ✅ STRF ("Strife") – Non-convertible Preferred:

* 10% fixed dividend
* Not convertible, appeals to fixed-income holders

#### ✅ STRD ("Stride") – Discounted Non-Cumulative:

* Priced at $85, offering >11.75% yield
* Junior to other preferred shares

Each issuance offered Bitcoin-backed exposure through a **cashflow lens**—making Strategy attractive to yield-focused family offices, pensions, and funds.

### Blueprint:

* Layer capital access using preferred tiers
* Provide exposure without selling BTC
* Match structure to investor type (growth vs yield)

### Outcome:

* Broadened investor base
* Avoided common stock dilution
* Engineered a long-term BTC acquisition flywheel
