## 1. What Is an LLP/PLT?

An LLP is a hybrid business structure‚Äîpartnership, part company.

## 9. e‚ÄëBOS (Electronic Beneficial Ownership System) for LLP/PLT

From **30 May 2025**, **all LLP/PLT in Malaysia** must submit or update their **Beneficial Ownership (BO)** information through SSM‚Äôs **e‚ÄëBOS** system via SSM4U.

### üõ†Ô∏è What is e‚ÄëBOS?
e‚ÄëBOS is an **online portal** for notifying, updating, or rectifying BO and senior management details under the *Companies Act 2016*.

### üìÖ Key Deadlines & Requirements
- **Mandatory from 30 May 2025** for all LLP/PLT  
- Non‚Äëcompliance penalty: **RM 500/day until rectified**   
- Submission is **instant approval**, except for rectifications that require review 

### ‚úÖ How to Use e‚ÄëBOS (Summary)
1. **Login** via SSM4U, click **e‚ÄëBOS** icon  
2. Go to **Beneficial Ownership Update** tab  
3. Enter your LLP registration number  
4. Choose to **Add**, **Update**, or **Cease**:
   - Provide details: name, DOB, ownership %, address, etc.  
   - Or report senior management if no BO identified  
5. Review summary, tick declaration, **Submit**  
6. You'll receive confirmation email; download and save PDF for your LLP BO register 

### üîÑ Rectification (Correcting BO info)
- Fine-tune or remove BO records by selecting **Rectification** tab 
- Provide either a **court order** or **statutory declaration**  
- Pay **RM 300** processing fee   

### üö® Why It Matters
- Aligns with global efforts to prevent money laundering  
- LLP must maintain accurate BO data or face daily penalties   
- Only specific authorities (e.g., Bank Negara, law enforcement, the BO themselves) have access to this info, not the public  

---

**Pro Tip:** Keep a copy of every e‚ÄëBOS submission PDF in your LLP's BO register. It‚Äôs a legal requirement and key for future audit or compliance checks.

## 10. Other Important Considerations

### a. Bookkeeping

Maintaining accurate financial records is crucial for tax filing and business analysis.

* **Non-operating Income:** Grants received are considered other revenue and may be taxable.
* **Accounting Template Resource:** The user provided a link to a Google Sheet template, which could serve as a starting point for manual bookkeeping. [Link to Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCJCnrKsvrCIXR_0-mrSRrOIr_vWVMOO/edit#gid=1301225604)

### b. Audit

While not mandatory for all LLPs under a certain threshold, an audit might be required by banks for loans or by LHDN during a tax audit.

* **Cost:** Audit fees can range from ~RM 1,100 to over RM 1,500 depending on the firm and complexity.

### c. Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF)

If your LLP meets the criteria (related to industry and number of employees), you may be required to register with HRDF and contribute to the levy for employee training and development.

### d. Finding Professional Services (Company Secretary, Tax Agent)

For complex matters, it's advisable to engage a professional firm.

**Sample Email Inquiry:**

```
Dear [Firm Name],

We have recently incorporated an LLP and have set up a bank account. We are seeking professional services for our new entity.

Do you provide services such as initial tax registration, tax estimation (CP204), annual tax filing (Form PT), and other related compliance services for a newly incorporated LLP? We are also exploring options for accounting and potential audit services in the future.

Could you please let us know if you can assist and provide a quotation?

Thanks in advance.
```
