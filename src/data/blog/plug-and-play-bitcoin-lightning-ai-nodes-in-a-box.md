description: We're launching pre-configured Bitcoin and Lightning Network nodes for the Malaysian and SEA market — with hardware options, local support, and potential for LLM integration. Here's why this matters for adoption, education, and sovereignty.

> You don’t truly own Bitcoin — until your **own node** tells you that you do.

Bitcoin is more than an ETF.  
More than MSTR shares.  
More than just stacking sats on an exchange.

It’s a movement — and a protocol — that rewards those who take sovereignty seriously.

Yet, most Malaysians — even the curious ones — don’t run their own Bitcoin node. Why? It’s hard. It’s technical. It feels overwhelming.

Today, we’re changing that.

**kheAI** is proud to launch:  
> 🔌 **Pre-configured Bitcoin + Lightning Nodes** for Malaysia & Southeast Asia.

Whether you’re a freedom-seeker, an educator, a Lightning entrepreneur, or simply someone who wants to understand how Bitcoin *really* works — this is for you.

## ⚠️ The Problem: You’re Not Running a Node

Let’s be honest.

Most Malaysians still:
- Rely on centralized exchanges.
- Use custodial wallets.
- Trust others to verify their Bitcoin.

That’s fine to start — but **it’s not where you stop**.

## 🚧 Bitcoin Isn’t Plug-and-Play (Yet)

Running a full node puts the trust back in your hands, is a **foundational pillar of Bitcoin sovereignty**. It lets you:

- **Verify** your own transactions (no trust needed).
- **Use Lightning** without middlemen / custodians.
- **Participate** in decentralized finance infrastructure.
- Explore Bitcoin from the inside out.

But setting one up? 
Most people won’t SSH into a terminal, sync `bitcoind`, or debug `lnd.conf`. 
It’s enough to scare off most people.

That’s where we come in.
