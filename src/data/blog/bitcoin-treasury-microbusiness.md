### Hold Sats. Operate Natively. Survive Fiat Volatility.

> “You don’t need millions in funding. You need 0.01 BTC and a plan.”

Bitcoin isn’t just for speculation or saving anymore.  
For **Bitcoin-native businesses**, BTC becomes the **operating treasury**.

At kheAI, we use sats to:
- Price our services
- Pay node hosting fees
- Fund open-source work
- Build long-term resilience

In this post, you'll learn how to manage a **Bitcoin treasury** at a micro scale—without needing a CFO, VC money, or complex accounting.

## 🏦 What Is a Bitcoin Treasury?

A Bitcoin treasury is when your business:
- **Holds BTC** as an asset (instead of/in addition to fiat)
- **Uses BTC** for operations (pay bills, buy tools, pay yourself)
- **Grows BTC** via routing income, subscriptions, or services

Unlike fiat treasuries, Bitcoin is:
- **Non-inflationary** (fixed 21M supply)
- **Borderless**
- **Instant to settle**
- **Censorship-resistant**

But it’s also:
- **Volatile** (in fiat terms)
- **Illiquid** if poorly managed
- **Needs custom tools for tracking**

## 🧱 How to Structure a Micro Bitcoin Treasury

Let’s say you’re a solo creator, service provider, or educator running a lean digital business.

You can split your treasury into **3 buckets**:

| Bucket         | Purpose                        | Ratio (suggested) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Operating**  | For spending, liquidity, bills | 10–20%            |
| **Buffer**     | Short-term price dips, rebalancing | 20–30%        |
| **Core Treasury** | Long-term BTC reserve         | 50–70%            |

💡 Hold your **core treasury** in cold storage.  
Use your **operating treasury** via a Lightning wallet or hosted LND.

## 💼 Business in Sats: Denominate Everything in BTC

### Why?

- Escape fiat mental traps
- Simplify international pricing
- Preserve purchasing power over time
- Think long-term, build antifragile ops

### How?

Use:
- BTC as unit-of-account (e.g., 100,000 sats per service)
- LNbits PoS for invoice generation
- OpenNode or BTCpayServer for fiat conversion (if needed)
- [Coinkite blockclock](https://coinkite.com/blockclock) for morale 😄

## 📊 Tracking BTC Cash Flow

Track **value in** vs **value out** using BTC-native tools:

| Tool               | Purpose                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| [LNbits](https://lnbits.com)          | LN wallet, wallet separation, PoS plugins |
| [Ride the Lightning](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL) | Visualize node income/fees          |
| [Alby](https://getalby.com)           | Web wallet for browser payments     |
| Custom GSheet    | Manual income/expense tracker |
| `bos` CLI         | Routing revenue, liquidity mgmt |

Track in BTC first. Convert to fiat only when needed (e.g., tax).

## 🛡️ Managing Volatility as a Microbusiness

BTC's fiat value can fluctuate 10–40% in weeks.

💡 Solution: **Treasury timeframes**.

| Timeframe     | Strategy                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1–30 days      | Keep in LN wallet, buffer dips w/ stable invoices |
| 30–180 days    | Store in hot/custodial wallet (BlueWallet, Phoenix) |
| 6+ months      | Cold store (Trezor, SeedSigner, or multisig)      |

Other strategies:
- Price locally in fiat, settle in BTC
- Hedge large income via DCA to stablecoins (if necessary)
- Pay small recurring costs in BTC (hosting, domains)

## 🔎 Optional: Proof-of-Reserves for Transparency

If you run a public service, a **Proof of Reserves (PoR)** dashboard builds trust.

Options:
- [Thunderhub](https://github.com/apotdevin/thunderhub): Channel balances + node data
- [amboss.space](https://amboss.space): Show node health + public channels
- Custom Nostr posts (signed pubkey + balance)
- Static page w/ xpub or multisig snapshot

Example message:
> “kheAI holds 0.05 BTC in long-term cold storage and 0.005 BTC for routing + service liquidity. Verified monthly.”

- Pay your mobile/internet bill via Bitrefill (BTC)

If needed:
