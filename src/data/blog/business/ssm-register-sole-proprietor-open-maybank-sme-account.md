## 🎯 Why I Registered kheAI Commerce

I founded **kheAI Commerce** to operate a lean, AI-enabled, Bitcoin-native business — grounded in:

- 🧠 AI & intelligent automation
- 🌐 Web3, Bitcoin & Lightning infrastructure
- 🏡 Airbnb & Room Rentals 
- ⚡ Sovereign Treasury & Decentralized Payments
- 📡 IoT & AgriTech system integration

I needed to:

- ✅ Legalize my income with **SSM registration**
- ✅ Open a **Maybank SME First Account**
- ✅ Separate business and personal cashflows
- ✅ Accept rental, freelance, Lightning, and digital revenue into one transparent account
- ✅ Prepare for **LHDN taxes, loans, grants & micro-SME financing**

---

## ✅ Step 1: Registering kheAI Commerce (Sole Proprietorship)

### 🔧 Platform Used:
[Ezbiz SSM Portal](https://ezbiz.ssm.com.my)

If your Ezbiz account is already activated, **no physical presence is needed**.

> You only need to visit SSM *once* to activate your Ezbiz account. After that, you can register any new sole prop online.
