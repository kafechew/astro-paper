# Introducing the Bitcoin Treasury & Lightning Dashboard  
## A Simple Way to Monitor, Manage, and Maximize Your BTC Strategy

A few months ago, I started asking a question that wouldn’t let me go:

> *What would it look like if a sovereign individual had their own Bitcoin command center?*

Not some enterprise suite. Not a trading terminal.  
Just a clean, focused dashboard built for **Bitcoiners like you and me** — people who want to hold BTC as a long-term treasury asset, explore Lightning as a payment and yield tool, and stay in tune with their Bitcoin financial life.

Today, I’m excited to introduce something we’ve been quietly building at [kheAI.com](https://www.kheai.com):

👉 **[The Bitcoin Treasury & Lightning Dashboard](https://www.kheai.com/dashboard)**

## 🧭 Why This Dashboard Exists

Let’s be honest: Bitcoin is simple at the core, but managing it well isn't always easy.

- You’ve got multiple wallets and cold storage.
- A Lightning node (or you're planning to run one).
- You’re tracking price, liquidity, yield, volatility…
- You want to *use* your BTC, not just HODL — without spreadsheets or mental gymnastics.

I wanted a tool to pull it all together in one place — without giving up privacy or control.  
Something that makes **your BTC strategy visible and actionable**.

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

The dashboard is still early, but already powerful. Here’s what you can do:

### ✅ View Your Bitcoin Treasury Snapshot  
- Track balances across wallets
- Monitor price, fiat value, and net worth in sats
- See your current asset allocation and BTC % exposure

### ⚡ Lightning Node Integration (Coming in phases)  
- Visualize node capacity and open channels
- Monitor routing activity and fee revenue
- Spot imbalances and plan rebalancing strategies

### 📈 Track BTC Trends That Matter  
- Live price feed and historical charts
- Key metrics for treasury planning (e.g., 200W MA, halving countdown)
- Macro context: inflation, bond yields, Bitcoin dominance

---

## 🔐 Built for Sovereigns, Not Institutions

This isn’t some KYC platform or centralized finance tool.  
It’s for:

- 🏛️ **Small businesses** adopting BTC as a treasury hedge  
- ⚡ **Lightning node runners** managing yield and uptime  
- 👨‍🌾 **Sovereign individuals** treating Bitcoin like a lifetime treasury  
- 🧘‍♂️ **Hermits in the city** who want financial clarity and simplicity

Everything is local-first. Private. Yours.  
Eventually, you’ll be able to **self-host**, **customize**, and **extend** it as you grow.

## 🛠 What’s Next?

We’re building this **in the open**, with feedback from people actually using Bitcoin for real life:

### Near-Term Features
- Import from Sparrow, BlueWallet, or xpubs
- Channel health checks + automated alerts
- Treasury forecasting: simulate BTC growth + fiat needs
- LN liquidity management tools (send, receive, rebalance)

### Long-Term Vision
- Plug in multiple nodes or wallets
- Smart notifications: e.g., "rebalance this channel" or "you've exceeded your 5% fiat threshold"
- Integration with kheAI Agents for Bitcoin-related decisions + automation

This isn’t just about monitoring.  
It’s about **operating** like a sovereign financial entity — even if you're just one person with a Raspi and a cold wallet.

## 🗣 Feedback = Fuel

I’d love to hear what *you* want in your Bitcoin dashboard:

- What metrics do you check every day?

## Final Thought

If Bitcoin is your long-term plan, it deserves a real dashboard.  
Not just charts and balances — but a **strategic command center** for treasury, payments, and freedom.

Let’s build that together.

Stay sovereign,  
**Kai 🧡**
